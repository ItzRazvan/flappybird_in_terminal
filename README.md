## *Flappy Bird* in the Terminal

*Flappy Bird* is a well known game where you must control a bird and make it jump, avoiding hittin the towers.

What I did is a recreation of it in the **C language**.
The game runs in **the terminal**, and I used the linux terminal for running it. 

You can jump on *space*, quit on *q* and pause on *esc*.

This is my frist game ever made, so it might have flaws, but it works.
